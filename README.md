# eyespy
Using a convolutionary neural networks to correctly identify multiple eye diseases. This was my 2021 science project, done in collaboration with jhan13 and Hiranya2007. It was a great learning opportunity to interact with tensorflow/keras, deal with allocating, pointing to, and seperating files/data, as well as having a greater understanding for machine learning (a term used to much these days as the blanket term "A.I.").
The data set for training and testing our model was downloaded from kaggle.
